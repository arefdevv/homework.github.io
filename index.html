    <h1 class="first_header">Introduction to OSI Model</h1>
    <p class="osi_para">OSI Model stands for Open Systems Intercommunication, is a theoretical model of how network communication works. It consists of 7 layers <br>  and each layer represents a specific function. The model allows different devices to communicate with one another while following the rules. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="osi_1">1. Physical Layer</h3>
    <div class="first_osi">
        <img class="eth_img" src="./eth_img-removebg-preview.png" alt="">
        <p class="phy_layer_para">Physical Layer deals with hardware transmission <br> of data over a physical medium such as ethernet <br> cable. The main focus of this layer is the physical <br> connection between devices. A real life example  <br> of this at FraudWatch would be ethernet cable that <br> connects to a laptop, which facilitates transmission <br> of data between devices.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="osi_2">2. Data Link Layer</h3>
    <div class="second_osi">
        <p class="data_layer_para">Data Link layer is responsible for the <br> data to be transmitted reliably between <br> two connected nodes. One example of <br> this at FraudWatch would be a FraudWatch <br> laptop's MAC Address which data link layer <br> uses to determine the source and destination of <br> each frame.</p>

    </div>
    <h3 class="osi_1">3. Network Layer</h3>
    <div class="first_osi">
        <img class="eth_img" src="./network.webp" alt="">
        <p class="phy_layer_para">Network layer is responsible for routing and <br> forwarding data packets between different <br> networks. The main function of Network layer <br> is to establish, maintain and terminate connections <br> ensuring data is delivered to its correct destination. <br> An example of this would be the routers at FraudWatch office?</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="osi_2">4. Transport Layer</h3>
    <div class="second_osi">
        <p class="data_layer_para">Transport layer's primary function is to provide <br> end to end communication and data transfer <br> between devices. Transport layer ensures that <br> data is transferred accurately, in order and <br> reliably. One example of this at Fraudwatch <br> would be a SOC team member accessing PP <br> from their laptop, the transport layer ensures <br> that the communication between the user's device <br> and the server is secure and reliable.</p>

    </div>
    <h3 class="osi_1">5. Session Layer</h3>
    <div class="first_osi">
        <img class="eth_img" src="./session.png" alt="">
        <p class="phy_layer_para">The main function of session layer is <br> to establish, terminate and manage sessions <br> on application running on different devices. <br> Session layer enables applications to communicate <br> and synchronize their activities ensure a <br> seamless data exchange.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="osi_2">6. Presentation Layer</h3>
    <div class="second_osi">
        <p class="data_layer_para">Presentation layer is responsible for preparing <br> data for the application layer. It essentially <br> acts as a translator that is translating data <br> between application layer and lower level <br> layers (session and ect.) so that both the <br> receiver and sender can understand.</p>
        <img class="data_img" src="./presentation.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <h3 class="osi_1">7. Application Layer</h3>
    <div class="first_osi">
        <img class="eth_img" src="./fraudwatch_international_logo.jpeg" alt="">
        <p class="phy_layer_para">The application layer is used by end-user <br> software such as web browsers and email clients. <br> It provides protocols that allow software to send <br> and receive information and present meaningful data <br> to users.</p>
